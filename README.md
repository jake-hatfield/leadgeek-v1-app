# Leadgeek App

This was Leadgeek’s core product for nearly 2 years, which is an online arbitrage sourcing list for Amazon sellers.

Each day, product research from retailers was compiled and provided to people flipping products via Amazon’s 3rd party fulfillment program.

I built it with the MERN stack and decided to publicize the repo since it's a now-deprecated product for Leadgeek.

This code is not to be reproduced and is intended for Leadgeek purposes only.
